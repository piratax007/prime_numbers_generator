# Prime Numbers Generation

An implementation of the [Miller-Rabin Method][1] to evaluate the primality of a number. This script generate a random odd number given a lenght in bites and use the Miller-Rabin Method to verify if is a prime number else generate a new odd random number until find a prime number given a lenght in bites and an error probability.

The script use and CLI to the user interaction from the command line and can to be import from another python script. To view how to use the CLI execute ``python3 primgen -h``.
